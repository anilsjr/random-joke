### Description

This project also includes a random joke generator that fetches jokes from an external API and displays them on the page.

### How It Works

1. **Fetch a Joke**: When the page loads or the "New Joke" button is clicked, a random joke is fetched from the "Official Joke API".
2. **Display the Joke**: The fetched joke is displayed in the HTML container.

### Files

- `index.html`: Contains the structure of the joke generator.
- `script.js`: Contains the logic to fetch and display the joke.
